## Difficulty: Easy
## Problem:
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number), and false otherwise.

### Examples
- Example one
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

- Example Two 
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

- Example Three 
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
