Solving Leetcode problems using JavaScript & TypeScript

## About this repo
Hey üëãüèª,
Welcome to my Leetcode repository! Here, I'll be sharing my solutions to various problems on the Leetcode website using JavaScript and TypeScript. This repository was created to test my programming skills and improve them. I'm constantly practicing and learning, so you'll find that some of the solutions might not be the most performant ones out there.
Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions provided and also add your own solutions. This is a great opportunity to learn from each other and improve our programming skills together.

## run JavaScripts solution
- Ensure that you have installed `node` on your computer.
- Uncomment the solution that you want to test in the `index.js` file.
- Run `node index.js` in your terminal.

## Run TypeScript solution
- Navigate to the root of the project and run `tsc`. This will create a `dist` folder inside the `solution-in-ts` folder, which contains the compiled code of each solution in `js` format.
- Run `node index-ts.js`.
